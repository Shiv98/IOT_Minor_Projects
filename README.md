# IOT BASICS Minor Projects
**This repository contains many minor IOT projects which were made in the basic module of workshop on AI and IOT by IIT Kanpur in collaboration with iSMRITI.** 

**Software Required:**
Arduino IDE

**The projects are explained below:**


# Led_control_using_Wifi
LED control using ESP8266 via a secured website.

**Hardware required:**
Arduino Nano, 
Arduino Nano Cable,
ESP8266 WiFi module,
AMS 1113 step down power supply,
Led,
Push button,
Jumper Wires.

**Steps:**

First upload the code to the ESP, after the code is successfully uploaded, then turn on the wifi on your end device, a wifi named Shivnano is created connect it by the password given in the code. After that , go to the web browser and type the IP 192.168.4.1 , a login page comes, login with the crediatials given in code, if the credentials are correct a page comes where you can control your led, else a pop up appears saying wrong credentials.

# Reverse_Car_parking_system


>The vehicle will move in reverse direction.

>Ultra sonic sensor finds distance frrom the wall.

>According to distance, VIBGYOR Pattern will produce using RGB according to distance starting from violet.

>At 5 cm, Green light emits and a buzzer starts, the buzzer continues till 0 cm.

**HARDWARES REQUIRED:**

>Node MCU, trasonic Sensor, RGB LEB, Buzzer, Connecting Wires

# RGB_from_app

> An app is made with the help of MIT App inventor with 5 buttons, red, blue, green, white and no color, the rgb glows according to the button clicked.

# LED_Intensity_Slider_controller

> An app is made with the help of MIT App inventor with sliders to control the intensity of leds and using the app, the intensity of leds are controlled.

# Servo_motor_control_using_Slider

>  A servo motor is controlled using a slider that is made on a webpage by the arduino code itself.
